Dublin Maker Faire was on and I brought my little rover along for the day.

I had the chance of presenting it at the Maynooth Maker stand and really enjoyed showing it off, it was certainly a big hit with the kids. Have to say they were very attuned to using an xbox controller and were keen on putting the robot through its paces. 

Apart from a few glitches and some battery replacements, the robot performed extremely well; lasting the whole day.

Kudos to the rest of the gang at the Maynooth stand. I was really impressed by the other works on show. Recognised a few bits and pieces from wandering about the Engineering department the past year. 

All in all, it was a great day and I'm looking forward to taking part again next year, and hopefully I'll have something new to show.
