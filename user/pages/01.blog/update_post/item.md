Wow, time does fly! It's been quite awhile since my last post so I've decided to write a quick update on what I'm doing.

For starters, hovering over the illustration above will animate it. It's another great example of what's possible with Snap SVG. And if you'd like to learn more, I've written a separate tutorial [here](http://www.gregorykelleher.com/blog/snap_demo) and the code for the example is available [here](https://github.com/gregorykelleher/snap_svg_examples). 

I've recently updated that Github repository to contain all of my Snap SVG examples, so stay tuned for more to come!

Talking about Github, I'm currently in the midst of house-cleaning of sorts, deleting and updating old repositories and creating new ones. I took a bit of a hiatus over the summer, but then again I was working so I have an excuse!

Besides, I was using Git on a daily basis anyways, and learnt a ton of things about rebasing, squashing and cherry-picking .etc, that I can now use with my own work. 

In fact, I already am. College started back up the end of September and since getting back I've been committing and pushing laboratory exercises to my dedicated repository [here](https://github.com/gregorykelleher/cplusplus_exercises). It's C++ programming for the most part, which is somewhat new to me, but I'm enjoying things so far. 

Another private repository that I've recently created is for the group project module we have at college. Essentially, the aim of the module is for each group to design and build a web application over the course of 10 weeks. 

I won't give anything away, but we're mostly decided on building something using Angular JS with a FireBase back-end. Hopefully, we should get to open-sourcing the project once it's been completed and graded. 

Hopefully, I should see that Github contribution counter go a little greener over the coming months!
