My name's Gregory Kelleher and I'm a student currently studying Multimedia, Mobile & Web Development as part of Computer Science at Maynooth University. As such I inevitably find myself tinkering on my own projects when I can - developing websites, building applications or perhaps dabbling about with some electronics. I also do quite a bit of design work, usually motion graphics nowadays.
