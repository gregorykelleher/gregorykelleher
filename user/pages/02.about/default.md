Hi, my name's Gregory Kelleher. 

I'm a student currently in my final year of Computer Science at Maynooth University. As such, I inevitably find myself dabbling in a range of activities. Whether configuring my web server, tinkering with electronics or dabbling in projects; I'm almost always at the keyboard.

You can get in touch with with me at gregory@gregorykelleher.com
