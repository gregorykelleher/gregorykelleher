My name's Gregory Kelleher and I'm a software engineer working for Qualcomm in Ireland.

I've always had a strong interest in technology, evident in my diverse experience across numerous technological domains. From IoT to automotive, I've built a comprehensive skillset building and testing software for real-world projects.

With a background in R&D development for Jaguar Land Rover and Intel, I've also been fortunate to have been involved in some cutting-edge projects down through the years.
