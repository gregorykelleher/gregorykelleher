My name's Gregory Kelleher and I'm an undergraduate, currently in my final year at Maynooth University. My interests lie across web development and embedded systems - the world of IoT.

This is most evident in my two recent internships at Intel R&D where I worked as part of the IoT Group for a combined total of 10 months. Outside of Intel, I maintain a website hosted on my own VPS, where I blog on what I'm doing. I also freelance, developing many websites and prototypes for clients over the last four years, most of which are hosted on my server too.

Education is a personal motivation and is visible in my volunteer work at CoderDojo as well as my time as a class instructor for CTY Ireland. I've also presented at Dublin Maker Faire with my university and more recently attended the Workday Intervarsity Hack-a-thon.

##Recent Work

**Centre of Talented Youth Ireland • Educator • Jan 2016 - March 2016**

Class Educator leading a class of 20 students for 3 months. Taught electronics and embedded programming using Intel Galileo micro-controllers.

Designed and delivered on my own course-work, including practical experiments building electronic circuits and creating embedded projects. My notes and slides can be found on my website [here](https://gregorykelleher.com/gizmos_and_gadgets).

**Centre of Talented Youth Ireland • Educator • Jan 2016 - March 2017**

Granted to be an Educator at DCU's Centre of Talented Youth Ireland again for a further 3 months. The course is based upon teaching students computer gaming using GameMaker software and tools.

**CoderDojo Ireland • Demonstrator • Sept 2015 - Current**

CoderDojo is a free computer programming club for young people of all ages. I volunteer each Thursday in my local Dojo at Maynooth University.

**Web Development • Freelancing • Current**

I've often done freelance work to develop and build progressive web applications and websites for clients through the years. Taking on side projects has enabled me to further build upon my technical skills, as well as providing an avenue for me to experiment with new technologies.

Most, if not all my work has been hosted on my own personal server and I frequently aim to improve on my work. Documentation can also be found on my website and [Github](https://github.com/gregorykelleher).

##Projects

**Maynooth University Student Planner • University Project • Sept 2016 - Jan 2017**

As part of my university programme I had to produce a web application as part of a team. Over the course of a semester we developed and deployed an online student planner application called MuHub using modern web technologies. The application was built using AngularJS with the Material UI component framework, supported by Firebase database & hosting. You can read more in my two-part series [here](http://www.gregorykelleher.com/blog/angularjs_project) or view the live demo
[here](https://cs353-project.firebaseapp.com).

**Arduino Rover • Robotics Project • Aug 2014 - May 2015**

Back in 2014 I decided to build an Arduino semi-autonomous rover from scratch, as a challenge to myself. It carries an infrared distance sensor, camera on swivel mount and an Xbee radio module. It can be set to full autonomous mode or alternatively be controlled over Xbee using an X-Box controller. I later had the opportunity of presenting it at Dublin Maker Faire in 2015. You can read more about it [here](https://gregorykelleher.com/robot_tut) or instead watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv33IRn4F5Q).

**Online Animated tutorials • YouTube Channel • Jan 2015 - Current**

I maintain a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Spokkam) online where I post educational tutorial videos on electronics and similar material. Many of my videos contain my own animation (usually motion graphics) that I design in Illustrator and later animate using After Effects. Since its inception, it's continued to grow and I've amassed over 10,000 views to date.
