My name's Gregory Kelleher. Originally I'm from Ireland but I'm now working as a software engineer in Austria.

I've been lucky to have experience in a range of software domains spanning Automotive, IoT, Cloud to AI Accelerators. Accordingly, I've built a proven track record contributing to high-profile projects across both Research and Production.

I'm well-versed in C++17 and Modern CMake, and have a keen interest in doing technical presentations in my spare time..
