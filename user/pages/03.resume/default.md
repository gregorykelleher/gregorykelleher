My name's Gregory Kelleher and I'm a software engineer at Jaguar Land Rover doing R&D for the latest in electrical vehicle architecture. I have a strong passion for technology, especially with respect to building embedded systems and IoT.

This is most evident from my two previous internships at Intel R&D, and most recently, in my current employment.

Working as a software engineer with both companies has enabled me to demonstrate and build upon my technical skills as well as offering me a valuable opportunity to work and collaborate with experts in the field; within a professional domain.

Outside of work, my interests in technology extend from electronics to web development. I enjoy tinkering with pet projects, and in my own time, I maintain an up-to-date website on my own VPS where I occasionally blog on what I'm doing.

My experience not only lies with systems and embedded programming, but I also have a strong background in web development. I've freelanced and developed many progressive websites/applications and prototypes for a number of clients over the last few years and still continue this at present.

Lastly, education is a personal motivation and I strive to encourage other individuals to pursue an interest in the field. This is visible in my volunteer work at CoderDojo, my time as a class instructor for CTY Ireland, and my educational blog and YouTube channel.

I've also presented at Dublin Maker Faire with my university back in the day and have attended several Intervarsity Hack-a-thons to promote the field of technology.

##Recent Work

**Centre of Talented Youth Ireland • Educator • Jan 2016 - March 2016**

Class Educator leading a class of 20 students for 3 months. Taught electronics and embedded programming using Intel Galileo micro-controllers.

Designed and delivered on my own course-work, including practical experiments building electronic circuits and creating embedded projects. My notes and slides can be found on my website [here](https://gregorykelleher.com/gizmos_and_gadgets).

**Centre of Talented Youth Ireland • Educator • Jan 2017 - March 2017**

Granted to be an Educator at DCU's Centre of Talented Youth Ireland again for a further 3 months. The course is based upon teaching students computer gaming using GameMaker software and tools.

**CoderDojo Ireland • Demonstrator • Sept 2015 - May 2017**

CoderDojo is a free computer programming club for young people of all ages. I volunteer each Thursday in my local Dojo at Maynooth University.

**Web Development • Freelancing • Previously**

I've often done freelance work to develop and build progressive web applications and websites for clients through the years. Taking on side projects has enabled me to further build upon my technical skills, as well as providing an avenue for me to experiment with new technologies.

Most, if not all my work has been hosted on my own personal server and I frequently aim to improve on my work. Documentation can also be found on my website and [Github](https://github.com/gregorykelleher).
