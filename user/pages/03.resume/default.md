My name's Gregory Kelleher and I'm a recent graduate of Maynooth University. I have a strong passion for technology, especially with respect to Embedded Systems and IoT.

This is most evident from my two recent internships at Intel R&D, and most recently, in my current employment at Jaguar Land Rover.

Working as an embedded software engineer with both companies has enabled me to demonstrate and build upon my technical skills as well as offering me a valuable opportunity to work and collaborate with experts in the field; within a professional environment.

Outside of work, my interests in technology extend from electronics to web development. I enjoy tinkering with pet projects, and in my own time, I maintain an up-to-date website on my own VPS where I occasionally blog on what I'm doing.

My experience not only lies with Embedded Systems, but I also have a strong background in Web Development. I've freelanced and developed many progressive websites/applications and prototypes for a number of clients over the last few years and still continue this at present.

Lastly, education is a personal motivation and I strive to encourage other individuals to pursue an interest in the field. This is visible in my volunteer work at CoderDojo, my time as a class instructor for CTY Ireland, and my educational YouTube channel. I've also presented at Dublin Maker Faire with my university and attended Intervarsity Hack-a-thons to promote the field of technology.

##Recent Work

**Centre of Talented Youth Ireland • Educator • Jan 2016 - March 2016**

Class Educator leading a class of 20 students for 3 months. Taught electronics and embedded programming using Intel Galileo micro-controllers.

Designed and delivered on my own course-work, including practical experiments building electronic circuits and creating embedded projects. My notes and slides can be found on my website [here](https://gregorykelleher.com/gizmos_and_gadgets).

**Centre of Talented Youth Ireland • Educator • Jan 2017 - March 2017**

Granted to be an Educator at DCU's Centre of Talented Youth Ireland again for a further 3 months. The course is based upon teaching students computer gaming using GameMaker software and tools.

**CoderDojo Ireland • Demonstrator • Sept 2015 - May 2017**

CoderDojo is a free computer programming club for young people of all ages. I volunteer each Thursday in my local Dojo at Maynooth University.

**Web Development • Freelancing • Previously**

I've often done freelance work to develop and build progressive web applications and websites for clients through the years. Taking on side projects has enabled me to further build upon my technical skills, as well as providing an avenue for me to experiment with new technologies.

Most, if not all my work has been hosted on my own personal server and I frequently aim to improve on my work. Documentation can also be found on my website and [Github](https://github.com/gregorykelleher).

##Projects

**Maynooth University Student Planner • University Project • Sept 2016 - Jan 2017**

As part of my university programme I had to produce a web application as part of a team. Over the course of a semester we developed and deployed an online student planner application called MuHub using modern web technologies. The application was built using AngularJS with the Material UI component framework, supported by Firebase database & hosting. You can read more in my two-part series [here](http://www.gregorykelleher.com/blog/angularjs_project) or view the live demo
[here](https://cs353-project.firebaseapp.com).

**Arduino Rover • Robotics Project • Aug 2014 - May 2015**

Back in 2014 I decided to build an Arduino semi-autonomous rover from scratch, as a challenge to myself. It carries an infrared distance sensor, camera on swivel mount and an Xbee radio module. It can be set to full autonomous mode or alternatively be controlled over Xbee using an X-Box controller. I later had the opportunity of presenting it at Dublin Maker Faire in 2015. You can read more about it [here](https://gregorykelleher.com/robot_tut) or instead watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv33IRn4F5Q).

**Online Animated tutorials • YouTube Channel • Jan 2015 - Current**

I maintain a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Spokkam) online where I post educational tutorial videos on electronics and similar material. Many of my videos contain my own animation (usually motion graphics) that I design in Illustrator and later animate using After Effects. Since its inception, it's continued to grow and I've amassed over 10,000 views to date.
